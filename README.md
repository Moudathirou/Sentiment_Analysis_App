Sentiment Analysis Application
Description
This repository contains a sentiment analysis application that leverages hybrid models combining LSTM, CNN, and GRU architectures. The application allows users to select different models for making predictions, and it uses advanced ensemble techniques like stacking and voting, achieving performance comparable to transformers on the chosen dataset.

Features
Hybrid Models: Combines LSTM, CNN, and GRU architectures for robust sentiment analysis.
Model Selection: Choose from multiple trained models for predictions.
Ensemble Techniques: Uses stacking and voting to enhance model performance.
Transformer-Level Performance: Achieves results close to or even matching transformers using stacking and voting techniques.
Optimized with Groq: Uses Groq hardware for accelerating model inference.
